# Roller Coaster Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a comprehensive dataset containing various characteristics of roller coasters from around the world. The goal of this analysis is to extract meaningful insights regarding coaster attributes such as speed, height, inversions, and geographic distribution, as well as understand trends in coaster design, performance, and status over time.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains 1087 roller coasters with 56 different attributes, including:
- **Coaster Name**
- **Location** (latitude and longitude)
- **Speed (mph)**
- **Height (ft)**
- **Inversions**
- **G-force**
- **Manufacturer**
- **Year Introduced**
- **Status** (Active/Removed)

## Key Insights
- **Speed and Height Analysis**: The analysis includes identification of the fastest and tallest roller coasters.
- **Geographic Distribution**: Explores the geographical distribution of roller coasters across the world using latitude and longitude data.
- **Inversions and G-force**: Analysis of the thrill factor based on the number of inversions and G-force for each coaster.
- **Coaster Status**: Insights into the current status (active or removed) of coasters and potential trends in coaster retirement.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

## Notable Features of the Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning**: Unnecessary columns were dropped to focus on key attributes like speed, height, and status.
2. **Visualization**: Various plots were created to visualize the relationships between coaster attributes, and geographic distribution.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: The analysis provides insight into the distribution and trends across various coaster attributes.

## How to Use This Notebook
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
3. Open the notebook and explore the results.

## Conclusion
This notebook provides a comprehensive exploratory analysis of roller coasters, identifying trends in coaster design, performance, and status over time. This project showcases my ability to work with large datasets, clean and prepare data, and generate insights through visualization.
